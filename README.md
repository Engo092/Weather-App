# Weather App

This project is a simple Weather App that uses the OpenWeatherApp API to retrieve basic weather data. It is meant to serve as an introduction to working with APIs, and is tecnically not that complex, but it still is pretty fun to mess around in.

The way this project works is that it has a search bar for the user to type in any city name, and then it retrieves that city's weather data, using the OpenWeatherApp API, and displays it on the page. The user can toggle between retrieving the data in imperial or metric units, and the site's background color dynamically changes depending on the weather that was retrieved.

I started this project by first experimenting with the API on the console, and after having a basic idea on how to use it i started styling the page. I had been on a long hiatus from programming so getting back to CSS took me a bit of time. After styling it i worked on displaying the weather data on the page, creating the toggle-between-metric-and-imperial function, and finished it off by dynamically changing the page's background color based on the weather.

Overall, creating this project was a fun experience, as i had various things to experiment with, and it served well to get me back into programming. This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.
